# Task Maven

Maven Lifecycle: default, clean, and site and all of them have phases. Phases rely on plugins to do work.

Default -main lifecycle
Clean- remove the /target folder
Site- creating a website

commands:
mvn install – for building project
mvn test – for test case
mvn clear – deletes the build directory named target and its contents
mvn package – if jars are not automatically created 


.m2 is local repository. It is used for storing all the dependency jars after Maven project is builed. My Location: C:\Users\milicasi\.m2\repository\maven
